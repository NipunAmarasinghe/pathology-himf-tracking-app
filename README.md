Problem

Pathology laboratories frequently rely on manual logs or fragmented Excel systems to:
* Track reagent lot numbers and HIMF identifiers
* Monitor expiry dates
* Capture supplier data
* Record intake timestamps
* Prevent reagent wastage

This creates:
*	Data inconsistency
* Compliance risk
* Increased manual workload
* Reduced audit transparency

* Barcode-based reagent lookup
* HIMF auto-population
* Expiry date tracking
* Supplier and category dropdown logic
* Multi-lab scalability
* SharePoint backend data storage
* Audit-friendly structured data capture
